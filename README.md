# Customer-Profiling-Using-K-means-Clustering
Customer profiling using K-Means clustering (Retail dataset)
Final Term Project – Artificial Intelligence
This project analyzes retail customer behavior using K-Means clustering to generate actionable insights for personalized marketing and product recommendations.

⸻

📌 Project Overview

This project applies data-driven segmentation to retail transaction records. Using K-Means clustering, customers are grouped based on:
	•	Age
	•	Gender
	•	Spending behavior
	•	Product choices
	•	Review patterns

The output helps retailers design better targeted marketing strategies, pricing adjustments, and inventory planning.

📊 Key Results (from your PDF)

Optimal Cluster Count: k = 5

Identified customer groups:
	1.	Gadget Lovers – electronics
	2.	Outdoor Enthusiasts – sports & outdoors
	3.	Luxury Buyers – home & living
	4.	Bookish Buyers – stationery
	5.	Fashionistas – fashion items
